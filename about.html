                Welcome to my portfolio! I’m currently a junior at Dublin High
                School looking to
                gain industry experience with regard to <span class="em">Web
                    Development</span>.
                In my free time, I like to study <span class="em">user
                    experience design, design
                    strategy, data science, and optimization.</span> My favorite
                courses
                include AP European History, Computer Integrated Manufacturing,
                and AP
                Language. Outside of school, I also follow a passion for <span
                    class="em">server-side architecture</span> and how
                applications can
                be built,
                managed, and scaled.
            </p>
            <p class="abouttxt">
                Before designer or developer I was a student first. My passion
                lies in learning about the world as it works and the data we can
                collect to <span class="em">build solutions to socio-economic
                    problems</span>.
                Initially, I was not someone who was keen on hammering away at a
                keyboard for hours in the pursuit of what I thought was a
                string of bits that did very little. After a lot of
                experimentation I was able to discover that development, in the
                same way I loved to create <span class="em">origami</span>, gave
                me
                a structured outlet for my creativity. Since then, my love for
                design, and data science has only grown.

                This summer I will be a youth instructor <span
                    class="em">@Tri-Valley Kannada Sangha</span>,
                an
                ethnic
                organization, and facilitate workshops for students on the
                basics of Web
                Development, and the Java programming language. I am also the

                works to provide students with a
                platform to showcase the talent they’ve been working on
                for a year. Outside of the realm of design, I’m developing <span

                context-searchable dictionary
                for technical terms. In the last two years I have also
                done lots of data
                analysis and visualization <span class="em"><a target="_blank"

                Outside of work, you can find me studying typography,
                design
                principles, and tech policy. You can find me listening to <span
                    class="em">Khalid</span> or <span class="em">twenty one
                    pilots</span>.
                You’ll never catch me without a hoodie.
